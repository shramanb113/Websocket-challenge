# 📂 Legacy Challenges

This directory contains the original, single-file solutions and experiments from the initial phases of the **Go WebSocket Challenge**.

## ⚠️ Important Note

As of **Phase 2**, the project has evolved from a flat structure into a **Professional Production-Ready Architecture**.

### Why the change?

To support advanced features like:

- **Database Persistance for user data** (PostgreSQL)
- **Type-safe UI Components** (Templ)
- **Clean Code Separation** (Internal/Cmd pattern)
- **Live Reloading** (Air)

### Where is the current code?

If you are looking for the latest version of the application, please head back to the root directory:

- `/cmd/server` - Application entry point.
- `/internal` - Core logic (Auth, DB, Chat Hub).
- `/views` - Frontend components.

### What's in here?

The files in this `/legacy` folder are kept for **historical reference** and for those following the step-by-step tutorials from the beginning. They represent the "Phase 1" implementation of WebSockets in Go.

_Happy Coding!_ 🚀
